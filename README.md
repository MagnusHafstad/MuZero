##Setup 

For first setup create a venv: `python -m venv venv`

Activate venv: `./venv/Scripts/activate`

To download requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you need to add new requirements (for example numpy) you first pip install it as usual. Then you run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Make syure your venv is active for this step. If not you will add all python packages that you have globally to this file.
